## 🔥 Critical Priority

### Code Quality & Testing Infrastructure
**Status:** In Progress
**Priority:** Critical
**Complexity:** Medium

Address critical code quality issues identified in the November 2025 codebase review:

**Testing Gaps (CRITICAL):**
- Add Error Boundary component to prevent full app crashes
- Add unit tests for all service layers (ShareService, ExportService, StorageService)
- Add component tests for critical UI components (0% coverage currently)
- Add validation for URL parameters in shared compositions

**Input Validation (CRITICAL):**
- Add bounds checking for resource limits (prevent negative values)
- Add max limits for unit quantities (prevent numbers like 9,999,999)
- Add payload size check for share URLs (prevent oversized URLs)
- Validate composition data structure before loading

**Type Safety:**
- Add PropTypes validation to all React components
- Consider TypeScript migration for better compile-time safety

**Performance Optimizations:**
- Add memoization for expensive calculations (useMemo/useCallback)
- Optimize bonus matching algorithm (currently O(n²))
- Add debouncing for search inputs
- Fix inefficient re-renders in ResourceTracker

**Accessibility:**
- Add proper label associations for form controls
- Fix emoji usage (add title attributes or replace with icon components)
- Ensure screen reader compatibility

**Immediate Fixes Completed (November 2025):**
- ✅ Fixed failing tests (population calculation expectations after siege unit fix)
- ✅ Fixed 14 ESLint errors (unescaped entities, missing curly braces)
- ✅ Removed hard-coded version string (now imports from constants.js)
- ✅ Cleaned up unused variables

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Error boundary catches and displays component errors gracefully
- All service layers have 80%+ test coverage
- Input validation prevents invalid game states
- No ESLint errors (warnings acceptable)
- Core web vitals improved by 20%
